# CAP-4621-DFS


Write a program that will find a path from an initial location to a final location using a “depth-first” search method. While doing depth-first search, if there are several choices from a particular node, the node with the smallest alphanumeric name should be selected first. 
Initial and final locations should be allowed to be input by the user 

The “locations” file includes the names of the locations and their x and y positions.

The “connections” file includes how the locations are connected.
